Once the dates are finalized (by the Coordination Unit), the Support Officer updates all group calendars and creates meeting folders for each meeting and ensures all appropriate documents are uploaded to system. Committee Members are advised a week before each meeting to read all related documents. The Committee Members hold their meeting, and the Support Office then produces minutes including any Action Points for each Committee Member. Within 5 working days, the Coordination Unit must conduct a QA check on the minutes, which are then sent to all Committee Members. The Support Officer then updates all departmental records.
