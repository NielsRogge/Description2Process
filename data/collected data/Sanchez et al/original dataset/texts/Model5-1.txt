The loan approval process starts by receiving a customer request for a loan amount. The risk assessment Web service is invoked to assess the request. If the loan is small and the customer is low risk, the loan is approved. If the customer is high risk, the loan is denied. If the customer needs further review or the loan amount is for $10,000 or more, the request is sent to the approver Web service. The customer receives feedback from the assessor or approver.
