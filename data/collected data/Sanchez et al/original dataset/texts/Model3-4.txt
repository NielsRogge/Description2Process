In the context of a claim handling process, it is sometimes necessary to send a questionnaire to the claimant to gather additional information. The claimant is expected to return the questionnaire within five days. If no response is received after five days, a reminder is sent to the claimant. If after another five days there is still no response, another reminder is sent and so on until the completed questionnaire is received.
