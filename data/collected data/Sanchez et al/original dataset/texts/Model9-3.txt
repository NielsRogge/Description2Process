In November of each year, the Coordination Unit at the Town Planning Authority drafts a schedule of meetings for the next calendar year and adds draft dates to all calendars. The Support Officer then checks the dates and suggests modifications. The Coordination Unit then rechecks all dates and looks for potential conflicts. The final schedule of meeting dates is sent to all the independent Committee Members by email, who then check their diaries and advise the Coordination Unit of any conflicts.
