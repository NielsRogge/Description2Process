After the Expense Report is received, a new account must be created if the employee does not already have one. The report is then reviewed for automatic approval. Amounts under $200 are automatically approved, whereas amounts equal to or over $200 require approval of the supervisor. In case of rejection, the employee must receive a rejection notice by email. Otherwise, the reimbursement goes to the employees direct deposit bank account. If the request is not completed in 7 days, then the employee must receive an approval in progress email. If the request is not finished within 30 days, then the process is stopped and the employee receives an email cancellation notice and must re-submit the expense report.
