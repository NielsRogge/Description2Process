The Police Report related to the car accident is searched within the Police Report database and put in a file together with the Claim Documentation. This file serves as input to a claims handler who calculates an initial claim estimate. Then, the claims handler creates an Action Plan based on an Action Plan Checklist available in the Document Management system. Based on the Action Plan, a claims manager tries to negotiate a settlement on the claim estimate. The claimant is informed of the outcome, which ends the process.
