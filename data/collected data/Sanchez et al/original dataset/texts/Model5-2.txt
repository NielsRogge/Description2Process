The process of Vacations Request starts when any employee of the organization submits a vacation request. Once the requirement is registered, the request is received by the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the vacation. The supervisor must approve or reject the request. If the request is rejected, the application is returned to the applicant/employee who can review the rejection reasons. If the request is approved a notification is generated to the Human Resources Representative, who must complete the respective management procedures.
