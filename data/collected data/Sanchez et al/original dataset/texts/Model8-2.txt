When a vacancy is reported to me, I create a job description from the information. Sometimes there is still confusion in the message, then I must ask the Department again. I am submitting the job description for consideration and waiting for the approval. But, it can also happen that the department does not approve it, but rejects it, and requests a correction. Then I correct the description and submit it again for consideration. If the description is finally approved, I post the job.
