When I have detected a number of personnel requirements, I report the vacancy to the Personnel Department. Then I wait to get the job description for review before it is advertized. Under certain circumstances, I must ask for corrections again, otherwise I approve the job description. Sometimes it also happens that the colleague from the HR department still has questions about the tasks and requirements before he can describe the job. Then I am available for clarifications, of course.
