The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel. When a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian, the room-service manager
 takes down the order. She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin preparing the food. She also gives an order
  to the sommelier (i.e., the wine waiter) to fetch wine from the cellar and to prepare any other alcoholic beverages. 
  Eighty percent of room-service orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage. Finally, she assigns the order to
   the waiter. While the kitchen and the sommelier are doing their tasks, the waiter readies a cart (i.e., puts a tablecloth
    on the cart and gathers silverware). The waiter is also responsible for non-alcoholic drinks. Once the food, wine, and cart are
     ready, the waiter delivers it to the guests room. After returning to the room-service station, the waiter debits the guest's
      account. The waiter may wait to do the billing if he has another order to prepare or deliver.
