After the Process starts, a Task is performed to locate and distribute any relevant existing designs, both electrical and physical. Next, the design of the electrical and physical systems starts in parallel. Any existing or previous Electrical and Physical Designs are inputs to both Activities. Development of either design is interrupted by a successful update of the other design. If interrupted, then all current work is stopped and that design must restart. In each department (Electrical Design and Physical Design), any existing designs are reviewed, resulting in an Update Plan for their respective designs (i.e. one in Electrical and another in Physical). Using the Update Plan and the existing Draft of the Electrical/Physical Design, a revised design is created. Once completed the revised design is tested. If the design fails the test, then it is sent back to the first Activity (in the department) to review and create a new Update Plan. If the design passes the test, then it tells the other department that they need to restart their work. When both of the designs have been revised, they are combined and tested. If the combined design fails the test, then they are both sent back to the beginning to initiate another design cycle. If the designs pass the test, then they are deemed complete and are then sent to the manufacturing Process [a separate Process].
