135;First a request is received . The customer transmits his data to the customer service department. The customer service is a shared service center between the sales and distribution departments. Then the customer data is received by customer service. Then a customer data object is entered into the crm system. When the data object should be compared with the internal customer database, it should be checked for completeness and plausibility. If there are any errors, these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list. The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times. In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base, a new customer object is being created. This object consists of data elements such as the customers name and address and the assigned power gauge. The generated customer object is then used in combination with other data to prepare the contract documents . This includes data such as bank connections, information on the selected rate, requested date of switch-over. Afterwards, an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the cis (customer information system) . In case of a negative response, i.e. the contract documents are not (or incorrectly) generated, the causing issues are identified. In the next step, the contract documents are generated once again. If a positive response is received , a confirmation document is sent out to the customer . Subsequently a request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the cis. It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future. Before the grid operator transmits a response comment, the request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence. Whenever there is supplier concurrence, the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers . Next the grid operator communicates with the old supplier. After that, the grid operator carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier. If there are not any objections by the grid operator (i.e. no supplier concurrence), the customer service creates a cis contract. The customer then has the chance to check the contract details. Based on this check he may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it. . The process flow at customer service either ends (in case of withdrawal) or continues (in case of a confirmation). An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days. The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary . The confirmation message will count as accepted after 7 days in any way . The confirmation message can speed up the switch process. When the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier, the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data. The grid operator sends the final billing to the old supplier. Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer.

136;The process starts when a request is received . Afterwards, the customer transmits his data to the customer service department. The customer service is a shared service center between the sales and distribution departments. When the customer data is received by customer service, a customer data object is entered into the crm system. Before it should be checked for completeness and plausibility, the data object should be compared with the internal customer database. Whenever there are any errors, these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list. The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times. If the customer does not exist in the customer data base, a new customer object is being created. This object will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow. The generated customer object is then used in combination with other data to prepare the contract documents . This includes data such as bank connections, information on the selected rate, requested date of switch-over. Thereafter an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the cis (customer information system) . In case of a negative response, i.e. the contract documents are not (or incorrectly) generated, the causing issues are identified. Thereafter the contract documents are generated once again. In case of a positive response, a confirmation document is sent out to the customer . Then a request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the cis. It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future. Later the request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence. The grid operator transmits a response comment. In the case of supplier concurrence , the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers . Before the grid operator carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier, the grid operator communicates with the old supplier.

The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times. In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base, a new customer object is being created. This object consists of data elements such as the customers name and address and the assigned power gauge. The generated customer object is then used in combination with other data to prepare the contract documents . This includes data such as bank connections, information on the selected rate, requested date of switch-over. In the next step, an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the cis (customer information system) . Whenever a negative response is received , the causing issues are resolved. Afterwards, the contract documents are generated once again. If the response is positive, a confirmation document is sent out to the customer . Subsequently a request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the cis.

138;At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded. A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the customer service department of teleco. At the customer service an employee enters a problem report into the system based on the received data. Subsequently the problem report is compared to the customer sla to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are. Based on this, the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities. An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship. If it is a premium customer , the process will link to an extra problem fix process which will not be detailed here. If the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon, the process goes back to reprioritize these measures. Taking together the information (i.e. contract commitment data + prioritized actions), a detailed problem report is created. Thereafter the detailed problem report is sent to service management. Service management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers. After receiving the detailed problem report, service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or not. If Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves, the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning. Whenever Service Management is sure they can analyze it, they perform the analysis . Based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem. Afterwards, resource provisioning receives the detailed problem report. Subsequently it is checked whether there are any possible problems. If resource provisioning does not find any problems, a notification about the normal service execution is created. Whenever a problem is detected , this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning .

201;Generally, customers drop their prescriptions in the morning before going to work (or at lunchtime) . Customers drop off their prescriptions either in the drive-through counter or in the front counter of the pharmacy. When dropping their prescription, a technician asks the customer for the pick-up time. In the next step, he puts the prescription in a box labeled with the hour preceding the pick-up time. For example, if the customer asks to have the prescription be ready at 5pm, the technician will drop it in the box with the label 4pm (there is one box for each hour of the day). Every hour, one of the pharmacy technicians picks up the prescriptions due to be filled in the current hour. The technician then enters the details of each prescription (e.g. doctor details, patient details and medication details) into the pharmacy system. Subsequently the pharmacy system performs an automated check called drug utilization review (dur). This check is meant to determine if the prescription contains any drugs that may be incompatible with other drugs that had been dispensed to the same customer in the past, or drugs that may be inappropriate for the customer taking into account the customer data maintained in the system (e.g. age). If any alarms are raised during the automated dur, they are reviewed by a pharmacist who performs a more thorough check. After the dur, the system performs an insurance check in order to determine whether the insurance policy of the customer will pay for part or for the whole cost of the drugs. In most cases, the output of this check is that the insurance company would pay for a certain percentage of the costs, while the customer has to pay for the remaining part (also called the co-payment). The rules for determining how much the insurance company will pay and how much the customer has to pay are very complicated. Every insurance company has different rules. In some cases, the insurance policy does not cover one or several drugs in a prescription, but the drug in question can be replaced by another drug that is covered by the insurance policy, when such cases are detected, the pharmacist generally calls the doctor or the patient to determine if it is possible to perform the drug replacement. If the prescription passes the insurance check, it is assigned to a technician . Before the technician puts them in a bag with the prescription stapled to it, the technician collects the drugs from the shelves . After the technician has filled a given prescription, the bag is passed to the pharmacist who again checks that the prescription has been filled correctly.

202;Generally, customers drop their prescriptions in the morning before going to work (or at lunchtime) . Customers drop off their prescriptions either in the drive-through counter or in the front counter of the pharmacy. When dropping their prescription, a technician asks the customer for the pick-up time. Thereafter he puts the prescription in a box labeled with the hour preceding the pick-up time. For example, if the customer asks to have the prescription be ready at 5pm, the technician will drop it in the box with the label 4pm (there is one box for each hour of the day). Every hour, one of the pharmacy technicians picks up the prescriptions due to be filled in the current hour. The technician then enters the details of each prescription (e.g. doctor details, patient details and medication details) into the pharmacy system. As soon as the details of a prescription are entered, the pharmacy system performs an automated check called drug utilization review (dur). This check is meant to determine if the prescription contains any drugs that may be incompatible with other drugs that had been dispensed to the same customer in the past, or drugs that may be inappropriate for the customer taking into account the customer data maintained in the system (e.g. age). If any alarms are raised during the automated dur, they are reviewed by a pharmacist who performs a more thorough check. After the dur, the system performs an insurance check in order to determine whether the insurance policy of the customer will pay for part or for the whole cost of the drugs. In most cases, the output of this check is that the insurance company would pay for a certain percentage of the costs, while the customer has to pay for the remaining part (also called the co-payment). The rules for determining how much the insurance company will pay and how much the customer has to pay are very complicated. Every insurance company has different rules. In some cases, the insurance policy does not cover one or several drugs in a prescription, but the drug in question can be replaced by another drug that is covered by the insurance policy, when such cases are detected, the pharmacist generally calls the doctor or the patient to determine if it is possible to perform the drug replacement. If the prescription passes the insurance check, it is assigned to a technician . Once the technician collects the drugs from the shelves , the technician puts them in a bag with the prescription stapled to it. After the technician has filled a given prescription, the bag is passed to the pharmacist who again checks that the prescription has been filled correctly.

204;A purchase request is initiated when an employee at the company fills in a form on paper. The purchase request includes information about the good to be purchased, the quantity, the desired delivery date, the approximate cost. If the employee wants to nominate a specific vendor, the quotes of the vendor are attached to the purchase request. Completing the entire form can take a few days as the requestor often does not have the required data. Afterwards, the employee sends the purchase request through the intranet of the organization . If it is urgent, the employee can hand deliver the form. otherwise , it is circulated via internal mail. More formally, the supervisor has to approve the necessity of the purchase and its conformance with the policy of the company (e.g. does a requested software form part of the standard operating environment?). Collecting the signature from the supervisor takes on average five days. Once a purchase request is approved, it is returned to the employee who initiated the purchase requisition. Later the employee forwards the form to the purchasing department. Afterwards, the central purchasing department checks the completeness of the purchase request . If it is incomplete, a phone call is made to complete the request. Based on attached quotes and other information, the purchasing department enters the approved purchase request into the enterprise system of the company . In case the employee has not nominated any vendors, a clerk at the purchasing Department will select a vendor based either on the quotes attached to the purchase requisition, or based on the list of vendors (also called Master Vendor List) available in the Enterprise System of the company. If the initial quote attached to the request has expired in the meantime, an updated quote is requested from the corresponding vendor. When a vendor is selected, a purchase order is automatically generated by the enterprise system. Afterwards, a fax is sent to the vendor. A copy of the purchase order is sent to accounts payable office, which is part of the financial department. The financial department uses an accounting system that is not integrated with the enterprise system. The goods are always delivered to the goods receipt department. The goods receipt department receives the goods. Subsequently a clerk at this department selects the corresponding purchase order in the enterprise system. Thereafter the clerk checks the quantity and quality of the good. If in the positive case, a document called goods receipt form is generated and stored in the enterprise system. The goods are then forwarded to the employee who initiated the purchase requisition. Then a printout of the goods receipt form is sent to the accounts payable office. If there are any issues with the good, a paper-based note is sent to the purchasing department and to the accounts payable office. The vendor eventually sends the invoice directly to the accounts payable office. Subsequently a clerk at this office compares the purchase order, the goods receipt and the invoice. This task is usually called three-way matching. Three-way matching can be quite time-consuming. If there are any discrepancies such as an error of the vendor or a data entry error, the discrepancies have to be investigated. The duration of the payment process unfortunately takes sometimes so long that the discount for paying in a certain period expires. When a bank transfer is finally triggered , a payment notice is sent to the vendor. Some vendors explicitly indicate in their invoice the bank account number where they want the transfer to occur. It may happen that the bank account number and name indicated in the invoice differs from the one recorded in the vendor database. Sometimes payments bounce back, in which case the vendor is contacted by phone, e-mail or postal mail.

Whenever the employee has not nominated any vendors, a clerk at the purchasing Department will select a vendor based either on the quotes attached to the purchase requisition, or based on the list of vendors (also called Master Vendor List) available in the Enterprise System of the company. If the initial quote attached to the request has expired in the meantime, an updated quote is requested from the corresponding vendor. When a vendor is selected, a purchase order is automatically generated by the enterprise system. In the next step, a fax is sent to the vendor. After that, a copy of the purchase order is sent to accounts payable office, which is part of the financial department. The financial department uses an accounting system that is not integrated with the enterprise system. The goods are always delivered to the goods receipt department. The goods receipt department receives the goods. Then a clerk at this department selects the corresponding purchase order in the enterprise system. Later the clerk checks the quantity and quality of the good. Whenever in the positive case, a document called goods receipt form is generated and stored in the enterprise system. The goods are then forwarded to the employee who initiated the purchase requisition. Thereafter a printout of the goods receipt form is sent to the accounts payable office. If there are any issues with the good, a paper-based note is sent to the purchasing department and to the accounts payable office. The vendor eventually sends the invoice directly to the accounts payable office. Subsequently a clerk at this office compares the purchase order, the goods receipt and the invoice. This task is usually called three-way matching. Three-way matching can be quite time-consuming. Whenever there are any discrepancies such as an error of the vendor or a data entry error, the discrepancies have to be investigated. The duration of the payment process unfortunately takes sometimes so long that the discount for paying in a certain period expires. After a bank transfer is finally triggered , a payment notice is sent to the vendor. Some vendors explicitly indicate in their invoice the bank account number where they want the transfer to occur. It may happen that the bank account number and name indicated in the invoice differs from the one recorded in the vendor database. Sometimes payments bounce back, in which case the vendor is contacted by phone, e-mail or postal mail. In case new bank details are given, the transfer is attempted again.; <act> fill in form </act>  <path1><act> attach quotes </act></path1>  <act> send request </act> <path1><act> hand deliver form

207;A university provides education and services to its students. First a student sends his admission to the university. When a regular student, i.e. a student who comes from a dutch high-school, sends in his admission form such a student is registered by the admissions office. Then the eligibility to study in a certain program is checked based on the information that the student provided on his admission form. For students who arrive from another school, such as a polytechnic, the previous study that the student took, according to his admission form, must be examined in detail. Students from universities in other countries are also accepted. When students are considered eligible and the courses that they have already followed (if applicable) check out, they are enrolled at the university, which involves sending a letter that they are accepted . Later the details of their enrollment are entered in the information system of the university. The students then become a student of their respective study: industrial engineering, building or construction engineering. After the students are enrolled, they can do projects . Projects are done on an individual basis by a student together with a lecturer. For instance, the lecturer sees the student after work.

291;A hospital wants to establish a rating workflow for their doctors . To make the workflow reliable, two different roles are assigned. The first one is a referee from the newly created quality assurance department while the second one represents the managing director of the hospital. Both roles execute all of their tasks independently from each other. The referee starts a new case regarding a certain doctor by interviewing patients. Since a patient interview workflow is already established, it is simply integrated in the new workflow. Meanwhile, the director asks an external expert to review the work of the doctor under rating. Unfortunately, since the expert only gets a low expenses fee, it can happen that the expert is not responding in time. In case that happens, another expert has to be asked (who could also not respond in time, i.e. the procedure repeats). If an expert finally sends an expertise, the director forwards the expertise to the referee. Once the referee files the results containing the patient interviews as well as the expertise , the referee creates a report.
